# advent_of_code
 This is a yearly challenge that happens in the run up to christmas every december.
 One of the GTAs helping teach one of my modules mentioned this to the cohort during semester 1 of my first year at uni and I thought I'd take on the challenge.

 The challenges come out one per day, and each one has 2 parts, each with a numeric answer to input into the website.
 The challenges vary in difficulty, but the idea is that the programming problems that get progressively harder day by day.
