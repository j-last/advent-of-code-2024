# advent_of_code

 This is a yearly event that happens in the run up to christmas each year and was reccomended to me at university, so I took on the challenge.
 It consists of 25 days of coding problems, each day having 2 parts and each part having a 'final answer' for the input data given. The idea is that the problems get harder as you get closer to christmas day.

 In the end I achieved part one on 24/25 days, and the second part on 15/25 days (which I'm fairly proud of for sticking at it!).
 I definitely could have gotten more if I'd had dedicated more time to it - but coding isn't what christmas is about!

 I would certainly like to attempt this challenge next year as it's taught me a lot about actually applying my coding skills and computer science knowledge to lots of unique problems. It was also great revision for my coing exam I have in January.
 However, next year I would like to keep on top of the problems better and do it under timed conditions to stop me spending too long on it!
